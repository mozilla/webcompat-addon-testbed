# webcompat-addon-testbed

This repository contains a testbed application used for manually testing and verifying the [WebCompat System Addon](https://github.com/mozilla/webcompat-addon/). In addition to your automated test suite, we'd like to be able to run manual verifications when needed, and this application provides a ground for implementing these tests.

For more information, please check out the [System Addon repository](https://github.com/mozilla/webcompat-addon/) or [our wiki page on wiki.mozilla.org](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Compatibility/Go_Faster_Addon).
